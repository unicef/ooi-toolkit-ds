This has to do with inherent limitations that may exist in the information collected. At some point, no technology or analysis will help you further. Considering whether the right data exists is critical at the early project stage. You may want to create contingencies to pivot towards collecting better data to answer the question. Or, if the data simply does not exist or is impractical to collect, revert to the original question of interest and redefine the project scope. This is about aligning expectations and gets to why the project was initiated in the first place.
