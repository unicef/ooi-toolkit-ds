This is when the results of the project are not those anticipated by the end user. This can be a function of not having the right data, poor model inputs or poor model predictions in specific scenarios. The possibility that the project might lead to poor results should be discussed among the project stakeholders. This addresses differences in how individuals might accept the results of the project and reveal inherent biases individuals might have. This avoids initiating a project where you already know there’s only one acceptable result.
