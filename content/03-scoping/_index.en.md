**Scoping** has to do with deciding on the objectives of the project and what makes it a good candidate for a machine learning or artificial intelligence application. Scoping can seem to be the most trivial aspect of a project, yet it involves the most fundamental part in initiating a project. There are a few questions a project team should ask before initiating a data problem: 

- Why is the problem important?  

- Who does the problem affect? 

- What if we don’t have the right data to solve the problem? 

- When is the project over? 

- What if we don’t like the results?
