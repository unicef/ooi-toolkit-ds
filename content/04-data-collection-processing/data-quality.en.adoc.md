Data quality is a critical concern for AI projects. Poor data quality can bias prediction results and mislead users.  There are six key areas of data quality:  

**Accuracy:** how well does the data reflect reality? 

**Completeness:** is the data comprehensive or not missing value entries in unexpected instances? 

**Consistency:** does information stored in one place match the information stored in another place? 

**Timeliness:** is data available when needed? 

**Validity:** is data in a specific format? Is it an unusable format? Does it follow business rules?  

**Uniqueness:** Is the data instance the only instance in which the data appears in the sample?
