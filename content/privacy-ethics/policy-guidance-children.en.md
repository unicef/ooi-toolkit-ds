As part of our [AI for children project](https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/featured-projects/ai-children), UNICEF has developed this policy guidance to promote children's rights in government and private sector AI policies and practices, and to raise awareness of how AI systems can uphold or undermine these rights.
The policy guidance explores AI systems, and considers the ways in which they impact children.

1. Ensure safety for children
1. Provide transparency, explainability, and accountability for children
1. Empower governments and businesses with knowledge of AI and children’s rights
